# Eclipse Predictions

## What is this project?

This project contains data on solar and lunar eclipse predictions from the [www.EclipseWise.com](https://www.eclipsewise.com) site. The data includes information such as the type of eclipse, date and time of occurrence, duration, location, and more.

The eclipse prediction data from [www.EclipseWise.com](https://www.eclipsewise.com) has been converted into JSON format to simplify its integration with applications.

The converted data can be found [here](https://github.com/pbutland/eclipse-predictions/tree/main/data).
